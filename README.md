You are absolutely right. My sincere apologies. I made an incorrect assumption based on the repository name and didn't look closely enough at the actual files on GitHub. Thank you for the correction.

A project that combines SQL for data cleaning and Tableau for visualization is a powerful and very practical skill set. Let's create a README that accurately and professionally showcases your work.

Here is a new, correct README file for your project.

üìä COVID-19 Data Exploration with SQL and Tableau
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data through a combination of robust data cleaning using SQL and insightful visualization via an interactive Tableau Dashboard. The primary goal is to transform raw, complex COVID-19 datasets into a clean, structured format and then use that data to build a dashboard that reveals key trends and statistics about the pandemic.

‚ú® Project Workflow & Key Features
This project is divided into two main stages:

1. Data Cleaning & Preparation (SQL)
The foundation of any good analysis is clean data. This project uses SQL to perform critical data preparation tasks on raw COVID-19 datasets.

Data Exploration: Initial queries to understand the structure, data types, and potential inconsistencies in the raw data.

Handling Null Values: Identifying and managing missing data points to ensure calculations are accurate.

Data Transformation: Converting data types (e.g., from nvarchar to datetime) for proper analysis.

Creating New Metrics: Using SQL queries to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) such as mortality rate (deaths vs. cases) and infection rate (cases vs. population).

Joins & Aggregations: Combining multiple datasets (e.g., CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations) and aggregating data to create a comprehensive, unified view for visualization.

2. Dashboard & Visualization (Tableau)
The cleaned data is connected to Tableau to create an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore the pandemic's impact visually.

Global Overview: High-level metrics showing total cases, deaths, and vaccination numbers worldwide.

Geographical Analysis: An interactive world map (choropleth map) visualizing the infection and death rates by country.

Time Series Analysis: Line graphs showing the progression of infections and vaccinations over time, allowing users to identify different waves of the pandemic.

Comparative Insights: Bar charts and tables comparing key metrics across different countries and continents.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Database & Data Cleaning: SQL (using Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, or similar)

Data Visualization & Dashboarding: Tableau

üìà Dashboard Visualizations
(This is the most important section. You should replace these descriptions and links with screenshots of YOUR actual dashboard.)

Global Infection Rate Map:

An interactive map showing the percentage of the population infected in each country, providing a clear visual of the pandemic's geographical spread.

Daily Cases vs. Deaths Trendline:

A time-series chart that tracks the daily new cases and deaths, highlighting the peaks of various waves and the lag between infections and fatalities.

Vaccination Progress by Country:

A comparative bar chart illustrating the percentage of the population that has received at least one dose of the vaccine across the top 20 most affected countries.

üöÄ How to View This Project
SQL Scripts: The SQL queries used for data cleaning and preparation are located in the SQL_Queries folder of this repository.

Tableau Dashboard: The final, interactive dashboard can be viewed on Tableau Public at the following link:
