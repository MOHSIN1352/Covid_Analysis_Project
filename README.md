# üìä COVID-19 Data Exploration with SQL and Tableau

This project performs a comprehensive analysis of the global COVID-19 pandemic. Raw data is cleaned and transformed using **SQL**, and the resulting dataset is visualized through a powerful, interactive **Tableau Dashboard**. The goal is to distill complex data into clear, actionable insights about the pandemic's spread, impact, and the global vaccination effort.

## ‚ú® Project Workflow & Key Features

The project is executed in two main stages:

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation (SQL)
The foundation of this analysis is a robust data cleaning process performed using SQL. Key tasks include:
* **Data Exploration:** Understanding the structure, data types, and inconsistencies in the raw data.
* **Handling Null Values:** Identifying and managing missing data points to ensure calculation accuracy.
* **Data Transformation:** Converting data types (e.g., `nvarchar` to `datetime`) for proper analysis.
* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new metrics with SQL queries to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) such as mortality rates and infection percentages.
* **Joins & Aggregations:** Combining `CovidDeaths` and `CovidVaccinations` tables to create a unified dataset for visualization.

### 2. Dashboard & Visualization (Tableau)
The clean, structured data is connected to Tableau to build an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore the pandemic's impact visually. The dashboard includes:
* **Global Overview:** High-level KPIs for total cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
* **Geographical Analysis:** An interactive world map visualizing infection and death rates by country.
* **Time Series Analysis:** Trend lines showing the progression of infections and vaccinations over time.
* **Comparative Insights:** Bar charts and tables comparing key metrics across different countries.
